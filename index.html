Brief Description of Goal of Code:
With this App 4 assignment, my goal is to take the lessons about coding I have gleaned from App Assignment 3 and apply them to a new topic I'm interested in! I hope to be able too put in an image that can resize, as well.
 
Known Issues:
None so far, as this task is basically an extension of App assignment 3.
